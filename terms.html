           1<span> </span>Welcome to the AlterTail platform (the "Site"). Please read the following Terms of Service carefully before using this Site or opening a AlterTail account ("Account") so that you are aware of your legal rights and obligations with respect to AlterTail Southeast Asia Limited and its affiliates and subsidiaries (individually and collectively, "AlterTail", "we", "us" or "our"). The "Services" we provide or make available include (a) the Site, (b) the services provided by the Site and by AlterTail client software made available through the Site, and (c) all information, linked pages, features, data, text, images, photographs, graphics, music, sounds, video (including live streams), messages, tags, content, programming, software, application services (including, without limitation, any mobile application services) or other materials made available through the Site or its related services ("Content").
